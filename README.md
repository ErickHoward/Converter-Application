# Converter-Application

**This is dead as I have switched to Linux ðŸ˜„. I may continue working on it in the future using either Avalonia UI or UNO Platform. I might also port it to Rust and GTK if I can learn enough rust**

A converter application written in C# using WinUI 2.6. There's no reason why you would use this over the Windows 11 calculator but maybe you could use it over the Windows 10 calculator since it looks better.
